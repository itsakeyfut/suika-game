// Bounce (Squash & Stretch) effect configuration

// Hot-reload enabled: Edit this file while the game is running to see changes instantly!
//
// SpawnIn mode (merge): fruit scales 0→1 with spring overshoot
//   merge_amplitude    - Spring oscillation amplitude (0.0 = no bounce, 1.0 = extreme)
//   merge_frequency    - Oscillation frequency in rad/s (higher = faster wobble)
//   merge_damping      - Damping coefficient (higher = settles faster)
//
// Impact mode (landing): fruit squashes and recovers at scale 1
//   landing_amplitude  - Squash depth (0.0 = no squash)
//   landing_frequency  - Oscillation frequency in rad/s
//   landing_damping    - Damping coefficient
//
// Settle threshold:
//   settle_threshold   - Deformation magnitude below which animation is considered done
//   settle_min_elapsed - Minimum time (s) before settle check activates
